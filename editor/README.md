# WORLDEDIT

Integrated development environment for WORLDENV game engine projects.

## Overview

WORLDEDIT is a cross-platform game editor built with Electron, TypeScript, and web technologies. It provides visual tools for creating, editing, and managing WORLDENV game projects through an integrated workflow similar to established engines like Godot and Unity.

## Architecture

WORLDEDIT uses a dual-process architecture:

- **Main Process**: Node.js environment handling file system operations, project management, and system integration
- **Renderer Process**: Chromium-based UI running the visual editor, viewport, and integrated tools

The editor embeds the WORLDENV runtime (TypeScript/AssemblyScript/WebAssembly) directly in the viewport for live editing and testing.

## Core Features

### Viewport & Scene Editor

Visual editing environment supporting both 2D and 3D modes. Provides camera controls, object manipulation, and real-time preview of game scenes.

### Entity-Component System

Hierarchical scene graph with component-based architecture. Entities organize game objects in parent-child relationships. Components define behavior and properties.

### Inspector Panel

Advanced property editor for selected entities with enhanced editing capabilities:
- Type-safe property editors with validation and error display
- Drag-to-change numeric inputs with precision control
- Vector2/Vector3 inputs with color-coded axis components
- Color picker with alpha channel support
- Dropdown selectors for enumeration types
- Multi-entity selection with shared property editing
- Undo/redo support for all property changes
- Real-time validation with constraint enforcement

### Asset Browser & File System

Comprehensive asset management system with real-time file system integration:
- Drag-and-drop asset import with format validation
- Grid and list view modes with thumbnail previews
- Context menu operations (rename, delete, organize)
- Multi-format support: images, 3D models, audio, scripts, materials
- Asset metadata tracking and search functionality
- Automatic folder structure creation and organization

### Engine Integration & Play Mode

Real-time engine integration with WORLDENV runtime embedded directly in the editor:
- Live scene synchronization between editor and engine
- Play mode with pause/resume functionality for testing game logic
- Engine state preservation and restoration when entering/exiting play mode
- Real-time performance statistics and error reporting
- Scene serialization to WORLDENV format (.scene.json) with validation
- IPC communication layer for secure engine operations
- Visual play mode indicators and engine status feedback

### Script Editor

Integrated code editor based on Monaco (VSCode editor component) with full IDE features:
- TypeScript and AssemblyScript support with syntax highlighting
- Tab-based file management with multiple open files
- IntelliSense, code completion, and error detection
- Built-in find/replace, code folding, and bracket matching
- Auto-indentation and multi-cursor editing
- Script file templates for components
- Dirty state tracking and auto-save support
- Integrated with project scripts directory

### Project Management

Comprehensive project lifecycle management with professional workflow:
- New Project Wizard with template selection (Empty, 2D Game, 3D Game, UI App)
- Recent Projects dialog with validation and cleanup
- Enhanced project structure with organized subdirectories
- Project Settings dialog with tabbed configuration interface
- Template-based project creation with pre-configured settings
- Recent projects persistence and invalid project handling
- Project metadata and version tracking

### Prefab System

Reusable entity templates with instance overrides. Create prefabs from scene entities, instantiate multiple copies, and propagate changes to all instances.

### Animation Editor

Timeline-based animation system with keyframe editing. Supports transform animations, property curves, and event triggers.

### Build System

Compiles and packages projects for deployment. Generates production builds for web browsers and desktop platforms (via Electron).

## WORLDSRC Language

WORLDEDIT includes WORLDSRC, a hybrid programming language that combines C/C++ performance with TypeScript/JavaScript flexibility. WORLDSRC serves as a superset of C, C++, and TypeScript, allowing mixed-language programming in a single unified syntax.

### Language Features

- **C/C++ Foundation**: Full C89 and C++17 compatibility with native performance
- **TypeScript Integration**: Complete TypeScript support including interfaces, generics, async/await
- **Mixed Programming**: C, C++, and TypeScript functions can coexist in the same file
- **Web Integration**: Direct access to DOM APIs, Web APIs, and browser functionality
- **Game Engine Integration**: Built-in support for Three.js (3D) and Pixi.js (2D) rendering
- **Hot Reload**: JIT compilation for rapid development iteration
- **Multiple Targets**: Compiles to TypeScript, AssemblyScript, WebAssembly, and JavaScript

### WORLDSRC Example

```worldsrc
/* 
   ===============================================
   WORLDSRC Mixed-Language Example
   ===============================================
*/

#include <world-render3d.h>

/* TypeScript interface definition for game entities.
   This establishes the contract that all game objects
   must follow for position tracking and updates. */

interface Entity {

  position: vec3;                    /* 3D world position vector */
  
  update(deltaTime: number): void;   /* frame update method */
  
}

/* 
         Player Class Implementation
           ---
           this demonstrates the hybrid C++/TypeScript
           nature of WORLDSRC. the class uses C++ syntax
           for performance-critical game logic while
           implementing the TypeScript Entity interface
           for type safety and integration.
*/

class Player : public Entity {

  private:
  
    float  health;                   /* player health points */
    
  public:
  
    Player() {
    
      health = 100.0f;              /* initialize with full health */
      
    }
    
    void update(float deltaTime) override {
    
      /* handle player movement input using C-style
         key checking for maximum performance */
         
      if  (is_key_down(KEY_W)) {
      
        position.z -= 5.0f * deltaTime;    /* move forward */
        
      }
      
    }
    
};

/* 
         Asset Loading Function
           ---
           this TypeScript async function demonstrates
           how WORLDSRC seamlessly integrates modern
           JavaScript patterns for non-performance
           critical operations like asset loading.
*/

async function loadAssets(): Promise<void> {

  const model = await loadModel("player.gltf");
  
  console.log("Assets loaded successfully");
  
}
```
