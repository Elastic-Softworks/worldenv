# WORLDEDIT

Integrated development environment for WORLDENV game engine projects.

## Overview

WORLDEDIT is a cross-platform game editor built with Electron, TypeScript, and web technologies. It provides visual tools for creating, editing, and managing WORLDENV game projects through an integrated workflow similar to established engines like Godot and Unity.

## Architecture

WORLDEDIT uses a dual-process architecture:

- **Main Process**: Node.js environment handling file system operations, project management, and system integration
- **Renderer Process**: Chromium-based UI running the visual editor, viewport, and integrated tools

The editor embeds the WORLDENV runtime (TypeScript/AssemblyScript/WebAssembly) directly in the viewport for live editing and testing.

## Core Features

### Viewport & Scene Editor

Visual editing environment supporting both 2D and 3D modes. Provides camera controls, object manipulation, and real-time preview of game scenes.

### Entity-Component System

Hierarchical scene graph with component-based architecture. Entities organize game objects in parent-child relationships. Components define behavior and properties.

### Inspector Panel

Advanced property editor for selected entities with enhanced editing capabilities:
- Type-safe property editors with validation and error display
- Drag-to-change numeric inputs with precision control
- Vector2/Vector3 inputs with color-coded axis components
- Color picker with alpha channel support
- Dropdown selectors for enumeration types
- Multi-entity selection with shared property editing
- Undo/redo support for all property changes
- Real-time validation with constraint enforcement

### Asset Browser & File System

Comprehensive asset management system with real-time file system integration:
- Drag-and-drop asset import with format validation
- Grid and list view modes with thumbnail previews
- Context menu operations (rename, delete, organize)
- Multi-format support: images, 3D models, audio, scripts, materials
- Asset metadata tracking and search functionality
- Automatic folder structure creation and organization

### Engine Integration & Play Mode

Real-time engine integration with WORLDENV runtime embedded directly in the editor:
- Live scene synchronization between editor and engine
- Play mode with pause/resume functionality for testing game logic
- Engine state preservation and restoration when entering/exiting play mode
- Real-time performance statistics and error reporting
- Scene serialization to WORLDENV format (.scene.json) with validation
- IPC communication layer for secure engine operations
- Visual play mode indicators and engine status feedback

### Script Editor

Integrated code editor based on Monaco (VSCode editor component). Supports TypeScript and AssemblyScript with syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and error detection.

### Prefab System

Reusable entity templates with instance overrides. Create prefabs from scene entities, instantiate multiple copies, and propagate changes to all instances.

### Animation Editor

Timeline-based animation system with keyframe editing. Supports transform animations, property curves, and event triggers.

### Build System

Compiles and packages projects for deployment. Generates production builds for web browsers and desktop platforms (via Electron).

## Development Status

WORLDEDIT is currently in pre-alpha development. The following core systems are implemented:
