# WORLDEDIT Development Overview

## Project Summary

WORLDEDIT is an integrated development environment for the WORLDENV game engine. Built with Electron and TypeScript, it provides a comprehensive suite of visual tools for game development, similar to established editors like Godot and Unity.

## Architecture

WORLDEDIT embeds the WORLDENV runtime (TypeScript/AssemblyScript/WebAssembly with Three.js and Pixi.js) directly within an Electron application. This architecture enables seamless communication between the editor and the engine, allowing for live editing, hot reloading, and integrated debugging.
