COMPREHENSIVE UI DEBUGGING TODO - PANEL VISIBILITY CRISIS
==========================================================

STATUS: COMPLETED - SUCCESS! ✅ UI FULLY FUNCTIONAL
PRIORITY: RESOLVED - ALL PANELS VISIBLE AND WORKING
SCOPE: COMPREHENSIVE FIX IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED

PROBLEM SOLVED
==============
✅ ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:
- Webpack target 'electron-renderer' was externalizing Node.js modules (url, path, etc.)
- PIXI.js and other dependencies required these modules but they weren't available
- This caused "require is not defined" errors preventing renderer execution
- Fixed by changing webpack target from 'electron-renderer' to 'web'

✅ CONFIRMED RESULTS AFTER FIX:
- All UI panels now fully visible and functional
- Hierarchy, Viewport, Inspector, and Assets panels all working
- Welcome overlay displaying correctly with New/Open Project buttons
- Menu system working (confirmed with [MENU] File > Exit output)
- IPC communication functional between main and renderer processes
- React application successfully mounting and running
- All renderer logs appearing correctly in DevTools

HYPOTHESIS
==========
The issue is likely one of:
1. React components not mounting at all
2. CSS/styling hiding all content
3. JavaScript errors preventing render
4. Context providers not initializing
5. Build artifacts not loading properly
6. IPC communication failures

DEBUGGING METHODOLOGY
=====================
We'll use a systematic approach to isolate the root cause:

PHASE 1: BUILD VERIFICATION
===========================
□ 1.1 Verify webpack build completed without errors
□ 1.2 Check dist/renderer/renderer.js exists and has reasonable size
□ 1.3 Check dist/renderer/index.html loads the correct renderer.js
□ 1.4 Verify no webpack externals are missing in renderer bundle
□ 1.5 Compare built bundle size to expected size (should be ~1.6MB)

PHASE 2: RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT CHECK
==================================
□ 2.1 Open Chrome DevTools and check Console tab
□ 2.2 Look for any JavaScript errors or warnings
□ 2.3 Check Network tab - verify renderer.js loads successfully
□ 2.4 Check Elements tab - verify #root div exists
□ 2.5 Verify React is loading by checking for React DevTools

PHASE 3: REACT MOUNTING INVESTIGATION
=====================================
□ 3.1 Add console.log to renderer.tsx entry point
□ 3.2 Add console.log to ThemeProvider initialization
□ 3.3 Add console.log to EditorStateProvider initialization
□ 3.4 Add console.log to BuildProvider initialization
□ 3.5 Add console.log to EditorApp component mount
□ 3.6 Verify React.StrictMode isn't causing double-mount issues

PHASE 4: COMPONENT HIERARCHY VERIFICATION
=========================================
□ 4.1 Add logging to EditorApp render method
□ 4.2 Add logging to EditorShell render method
□ 4.3 Add logging to each panel component render
□ 4.4 Check if components are rendering but invisible
□ 4.5 Verify Allotment library is loading correctly

PHASE 5: CSS AND STYLING INVESTIGATION
======================================
□ 5.1 Check if main.css is loading
□ 5.2 Verify no CSS is setting display:none on containers
□ 5.3 Check for CSS z-index conflicts
□ 5.4 Verify Allotment CSS is loading
□ 5.5 Check for CSS overflow:hidden hiding content

PHASE 6: CONTEXT AND STATE VERIFICATION
=======================================
□ 6.1 Verify EditorStateContext initializes properly
□ 6.2 Check if state.initialized is true
□ 6.3 Verify theme context has valid values
□ 6.4 Check if any context is undefined/null
□ 6.5 Verify useEditorState() returns valid data

PHASE 7: IPC AND MENU SYSTEM CHECK
==================================
□ 7.1 Verify main process IPC handlers are registered
□ 7.2 Check if menu actions trigger IPC messages
□ 7.3 Verify renderer process receives IPC messages
□ 7.4 Test if electron.ipcRenderer is available
□ 7.5 Check preload script is loading correctly

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
===================

STEP 1: ADD COMPREHENSIVE LOGGING
----------------------------------
Add debug logging to EVERY major component and initialization step:

1. renderer.tsx - Entry point logging
2. All context providers - Mount/unmount logging
3. EditorApp - Render state logging
4. EditorShell - Panel visibility logging
5. All panel components - Mount logging
6. Main process - IPC handler logging

STEP 2: REBUILD AND TEST
-------------------------
After adding logging:
1. npm run build
2. npm start
3. Open DevTools immediately
4. Document EVERY console message
5. Check Elements tab for actual DOM content

STEP 3: SYSTEMATIC ELIMINATION
-------------------------------
Based on logging results:
1. If no React logs: React mounting issue
2. If React logs but no components: Component rendering issue
3. If components render but invisible: CSS/styling issue
4. If everything renders: Layout/positioning issue

DEBUGGING IMPLEMENTATION
========================

FILE: src/renderer/renderer.tsx
-------------------------------
ADD TO TOP OF initializeRenderer():
console.log('[RENDERER] Starting React initialization...');
console.log('[RENDERER] DOM ready state:', document.readyState);
console.log('[RENDERER] Root element:', document.getElementById('root'));

ADD AFTER createRoot():
console.log('[RENDERER] React root created successfully');

ADD AFTER root.render():
console.log('[RENDERER] React tree rendered');

FILE: src/renderer/context/ThemeProvider.tsx
--------------------------------------------
ADD TO ThemeProvider COMPONENT:
console.log('[THEME] ThemeProvider mounting...');
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('[THEME] ThemeProvider mounted with theme:', theme);
}, [theme]);

FILE: src/renderer/context/EditorStateContext.tsx
-------------------------------------------------
ADD TO EditorStateProvider COMPONENT:
console.log('[STATE] EditorStateProvider mounting...');
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('[STATE] Editor state initialized:', state);
}, [state.initialized]);

FILE: src/renderer/components/EditorApp.tsx
-------------------------------------------
ADD TO TOP OF COMPONENT:
console.log('[EDITOR APP] Component rendering...');
console.log('[EDITOR APP] State:', { initialized: state.initialized });
console.log('[EDITOR APP] Theme:', theme);

FILE: src/renderer/components/EditorShell.tsx
---------------------------------------------
ADD TO TOP OF COMPONENT:
console.log('[EDITOR SHELL] Component rendering...');
console.log('[EDITOR SHELL] Panel visibility:', {
  hierarchy: state.ui.panels.hierarchy.visible,
  inspector: state.ui.panels.inspector.visible,
  assets: state.ui.panels.assets.visible,
  viewport: state.ui.panels.viewport.visible
});

FILE: ALL PANEL COMPONENTS
--------------------------
ADD TO EACH PANEL:
console.log('[PANEL NAME] Component mounting...');
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('[PANEL NAME] Panel mounted and visible');
}, []);

STEP 4: CSS INVESTIGATION
=========================
Check these CSS files for issues:
□ src/renderer/styles/main.css
□ node_modules/allotment/dist/style.css
□ Any styled-components or inline styles

Look for:
- display: none
- visibility: hidden
- opacity: 0
- overflow: hidden
- z-index conflicts
- position absolute with off-screen coordinates

STEP 5: DOM INSPECTION
======================
In DevTools Elements tab, check:
□ Is #root div present?
□ Are any React components in the DOM?
□ Are panels present but hidden?
□ Is Allotment creating proper layout?
□ Are there any error boundaries active?

EXPECTED CONSOLE OUTPUT (WORKING)
=================================
If everything works, you should see:
[RENDERER] Starting React initialization...
[RENDERER] DOM ready state: complete
[RENDERER] Root element: <div id="root"></div>
[RENDERER] React root created successfully
[THEME] ThemeProvider mounting...
[STATE] EditorStateProvider mounting...
[RENDERER] React tree rendered
[THEME] ThemeProvider mounted with theme: { colors: {...} }
[STATE] Editor state initialized: { initialized: true }
[EDITOR APP] Component rendering...
[EDITOR APP] State: { initialized: true }
[EDITOR SHELL] Component rendering...
[EDITOR SHELL] Panel visibility: { hierarchy: true, inspector: true, ... }
[HIERARCHY PANEL] Component mounting...
[VIEWPORT PANEL] Component mounting...
[INSPECTOR PANEL] Component mounting...
[ASSETS PANEL] Component mounting...

FAILURE MODES TO WATCH FOR
===========================
1. NO RENDERER LOGS: Build/loading issue
2. RENDERER LOGS BUT NO REACT: React initialization failure
3. REACT LOGS BUT NO COMPONENTS: Component mounting failure
4. COMPONENTS LOG BUT NOT VISIBLE: CSS/layout issue
5. COMPONENTS VISIBLE BUT EMPTY: Data/state issue

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS
=================
1. ADD ALL LOGGING (see implementation above)
2. REBUILD: npm run build
3. LAUNCH: npm start
4. OPEN DEVTOOLS IMMEDIATELY
5. DOCUMENT EVERY SINGLE CONSOLE MESSAGE
6. CHECK ELEMENTS TAB FOR DOM STRUCTURE
7. TAKE SCREENSHOTS OF DEVTOOLS

SUCCESS CRITERIA
================
□ Console shows complete initialization chain
□ All panels log successful mounting
□ DOM Elements tab shows panel components
□ Visual UI shows all four panels
□ Menu actions produce console output

ESCALATION PLAN
===============
If systematic debugging doesn't work:
1. Try running in development mode (npm run dev)
2. Create minimal reproduction case
3. Check for Electron version compatibility issues
4. Verify all dependencies are correctly installed
5. Consider starting fresh with known-working commit

TIMELINE
========
Phase 1-2: 30 minutes (verification)
Phase 3-4: 60 minutes (logging and testing)
Phase 5-6: 45 minutes (investigation)
Phase 7: 30 minutes (IPC testing)
Total: ~3 hours maximum

NOTES
=====
- Focus on systematic approach, not random fixes
- Document EVERYTHING you see in console
- Don't assume anything is working without verification
- Test in both development and production builds
- Check for differences in main vs renderer process logs

CRITICAL FINDINGS
=================

ACTUAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED: WEBPACK TARGET CONFIGURATION
------------------------------------------------------
The webpack.renderer.config.js was using target: 'electron-renderer' which automatically
externalizes Node.js modules (url, path, crypto, util, etc.) that PIXI.js depends on.

This caused webpack to generate calls to external modules using require(), but in the
Electron renderer process with contextIsolation: true, require() is not available.

ERROR: "Uncaught ReferenceError: require is not defined at Object.url"

FIXED: Changed webpack target from 'electron-renderer' to 'web' and added proper polyfills.

SECONDARY ISSUE: DOUBLE SCRIPT LOADING (Previously Fixed)
----------------------------------------------------------
The HTML template was loading renderer.js twice, but this was already resolved in earlier
iterations. The actual blocker was the webpack target configuration.

SECONDARY FINDINGS
==================

✅ UI SYSTEM EXISTS: Comprehensive UI component library found
   - Complete theme system with CSS custom properties
   - Button, ContextMenu, DropZone, ViewportToolbar components
   - Input components (DragNumberInput, Vector2Input, Vector3Input)
   - Allotment integration for split panels
   - Dialog system with overlays
   - CSS animations and utilities

✅ CSS SYSTEM WORKING: main.css properly imported and comprehensive
   - Theme variables defined
   - Allotment styles configured
   - Scrollbar customization
   - Focus states, animations, utilities
   - Dialog, context menu, tooltip styles

✅ BUILD SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL: All files compile successfully
   - Main process: 359 KiB output
   - Renderer process: 1.64 MiB output
   - No compilation errors

✅ WEBPACK TARGET FIXED: Changed to 'web' target with proper Node.js polyfills

✅ UI SYSTEM VERIFIED: All panels confirmed visible and functional in production

FINAL VERIFICATION COMPLETED
============================

✅ PRODUCTION BUILD SUCCESSFUL:
   cd worldenv/editor
   npm run build
   - Main process: 360 KiB
   - Renderer process: 1.68 MiB (512 modules bundled)
   - No compilation errors

✅ RUNTIME VERIFICATION COMPLETE:
   npm start
   - All renderer console logs appearing correctly
   - [RENDERER] initialization chain working
   - [THEME] and [STATE] providers mounting
   - All React components rendering successfully

✅ UI ELEMENTS CONFIRMED VISIBLE:
   - ✅ Hierarchy Panel (left): "No Scene Loaded" message
   - ✅ Viewport Panel (center): WORLDEDIT welcome screen with buttons
   - ✅ Inspector Panel (right): "No Object Selected" message
   - ✅ Assets Panel (bottom): "No Project Open" message

✅ MENU SYSTEM VERIFIED:
   - File menu items working (New Project, Open Project, Save, Exit)
   - [MENU] messages appearing in terminal
   - IPC communication fully functional

FINAL ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
=========================

The issue was NOT:
- Missing UI components (they exist and are comprehensive)
- Missing CSS (properly imported and complete)
- Build system failures (builds successfully)
- Component logic errors (components are well-structured)
- Double script loading (was red herring, already fixed)

The ACTUAL issue WAS:
- Webpack target 'electron-renderer' externalizing Node.js modules
- PIXI.js requiring url/path/crypto modules that weren't bundled
- External modules calling require() which is undefined in renderer context
- No module resolution = No PIXI.js = No React mounting = No UI

This explains:
- Why we saw "require is not defined" errors in DevTools
- Why main process worked but renderer failed to execute
- Why no renderer console logs appeared (script never ran)
- Why changing to 'web' target fixed everything immediately

CONFIDENCE LEVEL: MAXIMUM - FULLY VERIFIED AND WORKING
