# WORLDENV PROJECT CLEANUP & ORGANIZATION TODO
# Pre-Alpha Directory Structure Reorganization

===============================================================================
                             CRITICAL NOTICE
===============================================================================

This cleanup must be executed systematically to avoid breaking dependencies.
Test all imports and references after each major move operation.
Create backup before starting: cp -r worldenv worldenv-backup

===============================================================================
                          PHASE 1: ROOT CLEANUP
===============================================================================

## 1.1 Audit Root Directory Files
[x] Review all files in /worldenv/ root for relevance
[x] Identify which files are outdated/unused
[x] Check dependencies for each file before removal

AUDIT RESULTS:

FILES ANALYSIS:
[OUTDATED] README.md - Phase 8 era content, completely obsolete
[OUTDATED] package.json - Old Vite/TS/AS setup, not used by editor
[OUTDATED] package-lock.json - Goes with old package.json
[OUTDATED] tsconfig.json - Old TypeScript config, editor has its own
[OUTDATED] vite.config.ts - Old Vite setup, editor uses Webpack
[OUTDATED] index.html - Old web entry point, not used
[OUTDATED] asconnfig.json - Old AssemblyScript config, minimal content
[OUTDATED] copy - Development note file from early phases
[KEEP/UPDATE] .gitignore - Comprehensive, needs updating for new structure

DIRECTORIES ANALYSIS:
[OUTDATED] asm/ - Contains single index.ts file, old AssemblyScript
[OUTDATED] build/ - Old build output directory
[OUTDATED] dist/ - Old distribution directory (different from editor/dist)
[OUTDATED] docs/ - Old documentation, editor has current docs
[OUTDATED] node_modules/ - Old dependencies for removed package.json
[OUTDATED] projects/ - Test projects, should be in editor if needed
[OUTDATED] public/ - Old static assets for web version
[OUTDATED] scripts/ - Old build scripts for removed setup
[OUTDATED] src/ - Old TypeScript source (main.ts + components/core/scenes)

DEPENDENCY CHECK:
- Editor does NOT import any root level files
- Editor has its own package.json, tsconfig.json, webpack configs
- No references to root vite.config.ts or old build system
- Root .gitignore is comprehensive and should be preserved/updated
- All root content is from Phase 8 era or earlier - completely obsolete

## 1.2 Remove Outdated Root Files
[x] DELETE: worldenv/README.md (Phase 8 era, completely outdated)
[x] DELETE: worldenv/package.json (old TypeScript/AS setup)
[x] DELETE: worldenv/package-lock.json
[x] DELETE: worldenv/tsconfig.json (old config)
[x] DELETE: worldenv/vite.config.ts (obsolete)
[x] DELETE: worldenv/index.html (old web setup)
[x] DELETE: worldenv/asconnfig.json (old AssemblyScript config)
[x] DELETE: worldenv/copy (unknown file)
[x] REVIEW: worldenv/.gitignore (updated with WORLDSRC patterns)

## 1.3 Remove Outdated Root Directories
[x] DELETE: worldenv/asm/ (old AssemblyScript source)
[x] DELETE: worldenv/build/ (old build output)
[x] DELETE: worldenv/dist/ (old distribution, not editor/dist)
[x] DELETE: worldenv/docs/ (old documentation)
[x] DELETE: worldenv/node_modules/ (old dependencies)
[x] DELETE: worldenv/projects/ (test projects, should be in editor)
[x] DELETE: worldenv/public/ (old static assets)
[x] DELETE: worldenv/scripts/ (old build scripts)
[x] DELETE: worldenv/src/ (old TypeScript source)

PHASE 1 VERIFICATION:
Root directory now contains only:
- worldenv/.gitignore (updated for new structure)
- worldenv/editor/ (current editor implementation)

All Phase 8 era obsolete files and directories successfully removed.
Zero dependency breaks confirmed - editor remains fully functional.

===============================================================================
                      PHASE 2: WORLDSRC EXTRACTION
===============================================================================

## 2.1 Create New WORLDSRC Root Structure
[x] CREATE: worldenv/worldsrc/ (new root directory)

[x] CREATE: worldsrc/README.md (WORLDSRC standalone readme)
[x] CREATE: worldsrc/.gitignore (WORLDSRC specific ignores)

PHASE 2 VERIFICATION:
WORLDSRC is now completely standalone:
- worldsrc/src/ contains all language implementation
- worldsrc/docs/ contains all language documentation
- worldsrc/dist/ contains compiled output
- worldsrc/tests/ contains complete test suite
- worldsrc/package.json configures standalone package
- All WORLDSRC content removed from editor/

Editor structure cleaned:
- editor/src/worldsrc/ → REMOVED
- editor/dist/worldsrc/ → REMOVED
- editor/docs/worldsrc/ → REMOVED

WORLDSRC extraction complete - zero editor dependencies.

===============================================================================
                    PHASE 3: UPDATE IMPORT REFERENCES
===============================================================================

## 3.1 Update Editor Imports

[x] UPDATE: Change to reference external worldsrc package
[x] TEST: Verify all editor functionality still works

## 3.2 Update Build Scripts
[x] UPDATE: editor/webpack configs to reference external worldsrc
[x] UPDATE: Any build scripts that compile worldsrc
[x] TEST: Verify editor build process works

## 3.3 Update Package Dependencies
[x] UPDATE: editor/package.json to include worldsrc as dependency
[x] UPDATE: Any workspace/monorepo configuration
[x] TEST: npm install and build process

PHASE 3 VERIFICATION:
Import reference updates complete:
- Zero old './worldsrc/' imports found in editor
- Editor references to WORLDSRC are language/format references (valid)
- Webpack configs contain no hardcoded worldsrc paths
- Added @worldenv/worldsrc dependency to editor package.json
- Editor builds successfully (main and renderer processes)
- Development builds work correctly

No breaking import changes required - editor was already properly decoupled.
WORLDSRC integration ready for Phase 4 documentation consolidation.

===============================================================================
                              EXECUTION NOTES
===============================================================================

1. BACKUP FIRST: Always create full backup before starting
2. TEST INCREMENTALLY: After each major move, test functionality
3. UPDATE GRADUALLY: Don't move everything at once
4. VERIFY IMPORTS: Check all import statements after moves
5. DOCUMENT CHANGES: Update any internal documentation
6. COMMUNICATE: Ensure team is aware of structural changes

ESTIMATED TIME: 8-12 hours for complete reorganization
PRIORITY: HIGH - Required before pre-alpha testing begins
RISK LEVEL: MEDIUM - Structural changes require careful testing

===============================================================================
                                   END
