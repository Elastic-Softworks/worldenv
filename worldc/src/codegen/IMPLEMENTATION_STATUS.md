## Usage Examples

### Basic Compilation
```typescript
import { WorldCCodeGenerator, CompilationTarget } from './codegen';

const generator = new WorldCCodeGenerator();
const result = await generator.compile({
  sourceCode: worldcSource,
  targets: CompilationTarget.TYPESCRIPT,
  outputDirectory: './dist'
});
```

### Multi-Target Compilation
```typescript
const result = await generator.compileMultiTarget(
  sourceCode,
  [CompilationTarget.TYPESCRIPT, CompilationTarget.ASSEMBLYSCRIPT],
  { optimizationLevel: OptimizationLevel.AGGRESSIVE }
);
```

### Pipeline Integration
```typescript
const pipeline = new CompilationPipeline({
  onProgress: (progress, message) => console.log(`${progress}%: ${message}`)
});

const result = await pipeline.compile(request);
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority
1. **Advanced Tooling Integration**
   - Language server protocol implementation
   - Real-time compilation feedback
   - Advanced debugging support

2. **IDE Features**
   - IntelliSense and autocomplete
   - Error highlighting and quick fixes
   - Refactoring tools

### Future Enhancements
1. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Incremental compilation
   - Build caching
   - Parallel processing improvements

2. **Additional Targets**
   - Direct WebAssembly generation
   - JavaScript ES5/ES6 variants
   - Custom target plugins

## Conclusion

This implementation represents a major milestone in WORLDC development. The code generation and compilation system is architecturally complete and ready for production use. The framework provides a solid foundation for advanced tooling integration and supports the full development workflow from source code to deployable artifacts.

The implementation successfully bridges the gap between WORLDC's hybrid syntax and practical target languages, enabling developers to write game code in the familiar C/C++/TypeScript hybrid format while generating optimized output for web deployment.

**Status: COMPLETE - Ready for Advanced Tooling Integration**
