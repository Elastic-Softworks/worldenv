WORLDENV CONTEXT PRESERVATION NOTES
===================================

CURRENT SYSTEM STATE
====================

Architecture Overview:
- Editor: Electron-based application (TypeScript/React)
- WorldC: C-based compiler and language tooling
- Integration: IPC-based communication between editor and compiler

Key Components:
- Editor Main Process: /worldenv/editor/src/main/
- Editor Renderer: /worldenv/editor/src/renderer/
- WorldC Compiler: /worldenv/worldc/src/
- Documentation: /worldenv/editor/docs/ and /worldenv/worldc/docs/

RECENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS
============================

Completed from test3-todo.txt:
- Engine integration foundation (EngineService, EngineCommunicationManager)
- Scene management system (SceneManager, scene creation/loading)
- Asset pipeline (AssetManager with import/export capabilities)
- Component system (Inspector panels, property editing)
- Build system integration (BuildManager, WorldC compilation)
- Script system (ScriptSystemManager, hot reload)
- UI enhancements (dialogs, tooltips, keyboard shortcuts)
- Testing framework setup (unit tests, integration tests)

Current Issues Identified:
- EPIPE errors in WorldC compiler integration
- Large renderer bundle size (1.94 MiB)
- Dynamic require warnings in webpack builds
- Runtime discovery issues for WorldC compiler path
- Multiple Manager classes with overlapping responsibilities

CLEANUP ANALYSIS FINDINGS
=========================

File Structure Issues:
- 15+ Manager classes in editor/src/main/ with potential overlap
- Disabled file: worldc/src/semantic/semantic-analyzer.ts.disabled
- Mixed naming conventions (snake_case vs camelCase)
- Scattered debug logging calls throughout codebase

Integration Problems:
- Engine communication chain too complex (multiple layers)
- WCCompilerIntegration + WCHotReloadManager redundancy
- IPC management split across multiple classes

Code Quality Issues:
- Extensive debug logging in production paths
- TODO/FIXME comments throughout codebase
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- C-FORM compliance needed in applicable code

Documentation Status:
- All major docs updated (USER-GUIDE, DEVELOPER-GUIDE, API-REFERENCE, etc.)
- Development phase references removed
- Emojis cleaned from all documentation
- Documentation reflects current implementation state

LIVE BLUEPRINT SYSTEM
=====================

Purpose:
- Comprehensive system visualization and analysis tool
- Real-time monitoring and debugging capabilities
- Code flow tracing and dependency mapping
- Integration testing support

Implementation Location:
- /worldenv/hitl/worldenv-liveblueprint/
- HTML/CSS/JS web application with D3.js visualizations
- Analysis engine for C and TypeScript code parsing
- File system monitoring and change detection

Key Features:
- Visual system architecture diagrams
- Textual execution flow descriptions
- Debug tools for issue detection
- Real-time system monitoring
- Code explorer with analysis

COMPLETED WORK
=============

Critical Fixes Completed:
1. [X] Remove worldc/src/semantic/semantic-analyzer.ts.disabled
2. [X] Fix dynamic require warnings in WCCompilerIntegration.ts
3. [X] Standardize naming consistency in auto-save.ts (snake_case → camelCase)
4. [X] Implement live blueprint system framework (index.html, script.js, style.css)
5. [X] Update all documentation to reflect current state

Build System Status:
- Main process: Clean build (zero warnings)
- Renderer process: Builds successfully (performance warnings only)
- All tests passing: WorldC (8/8 tests)
- Dynamic require warnings resolved

REMAINING PRIORITIES
===================

Architecture Optimization:
1. Consolidate Manager classes with overlapping functionality
2. Optimize renderer bundle size (1.94 MiB → target <500KB)
3. Implement code splitting for large UI components
4. Streamline engine integration architecture

Integration Fixes:
1. Resolve EPIPE errors in compiler communication
2. Implement graceful compiler discovery fallback
3. Add proper error boundaries for missing components
4. Complete hot-reload system integration

Code Quality:
1. Standardize remaining naming inconsistencies in other Manager files
2. Reduce excessive debug logging calls (50+ instances identified)
3. Implement C-FORM compliance in applicable TypeScript code
4. Add comprehensive unit test coverage for consolidated managers

BUILD STATUS
===========

Editor Build: SUCCESS (CLEAN)
- Main bundle: CLEAN BUILD (zero warnings after fixes)
- Renderer bundle: 1.94 MiB (performance warnings only)
- Dynamic require warning RESOLVED in WCCompilerIntegration.ts

WorldC Build: SUCCESS
- Jest tests: 8/8 passing (basic.test.ts)
- Compilation pipeline functional
- Runtime integration needs work (EPIPE errors persist)

BLUEPRINT SYSTEM: IMPLEMENTED
- Live analysis tool deployed at /worldenv/hitl/worldenv-liveblueprint/
- Visual system architecture mapping with D3.js
- Real-time file monitoring and change detection
- Code flow tracing and dependency analysis
- Debug tools for issue detection and performance monitoring

DEVELOPMENT NOTES
================

Key Patterns Observed:
- Manager classes follow consistent constructor patterns
- IPC communication uses standardized message formats
- Error handling varies between subsystems
- Configuration management inconsistent across components

Architectural Decisions:
- Singleton patterns used for core managers
- Event-driven communication between components
- Modular build system with separate configs
- Template-based project scaffolding

Integration Points:
- Main process <-> Renderer process (Electron IPC)
- Editor <-> WorldC compiler (child process)
- File system <-> Asset pipeline (chokidar watching)
- Build system <-> Multiple compilation targets

EXTENSION POINTS
===============

Live Blueprint System:
- Plugin architecture for custom analyzers
- Export formats for documentation generation
- Integration with external tools (IDEs, CI/CD)
- Real-time collaboration features

Cleanup System:
- Automated refactoring tools
- Code quality metrics dashboard
- Dependency analysis and optimization
- Performance monitoring integration

Future Enhancements:
- Language server protocol implementation
- Advanced debugging protocol support
- Cloud-based compilation services
- Collaborative development features
