TEST 1 PRIORITY BUG FIXES - WORLDEDIT EDITOR
==============================================

PROGRESS TRACKING
==================
STARTED: 2025-01-21
LAST UPDATED: 2025-01-21 (Implementation Phase)
STATUS: SOURCE CODE UPDATED - READY FOR BUILD AND TEST

CRITICAL DISCOVERY
==================
ROOT CAUSE: Application was never built after source code changes
- No dist/ directory existed
- Changes in source files were not compiled
- User was attempting to run non-existent build artifacts
- This explains why NO changes were visible in previous testing

COMPLETED ITEMS: 7/10
- [COMPLETED] Item 1: EditorApp.tsx - Fixed to always render EditorShell
- [COMPLETED] Item 2: ViewportPanel.tsx - Welcome overlay already exists
- [COMPLETED] Item 3: Menu System - Added console logging to File menu
- [COMPLETED] Item 6: Splash Screen - Branding and timing already updated
- [COMPLETED] Item 7: Splash Screen Animation - Already implemented
- [COMPLETED] Item 8: Menu Logging - Edit/View/Build menus already have logging
- [COMPLETED] Item 9: Build Script - Created BUILD-AND-TEST.sh

PENDING ITEMS: 3/10 (Need Build & Test)
- [PENDING] Item 4: Main Layout System - Needs testing after build
- [PENDING] Item 5: Window Controls - Needs testing after build
- [PENDING] Item 10: Graphics Fallback - Needs verification

NEXT UP: BUILD THE APPLICATION (CRITICAL)

IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
=====================

STEP 1: BUILD THE APPLICATION (REQUIRED)
-----------------------------------------
Run the build script from worldenv/editor directory:

  cd worldenv/editor
  ./BUILD-AND-TEST.sh

Or manually:

  cd worldenv/editor
  npm install
  npm run build:main
  npm run build:renderer
  npm start

STEP 2: VERIFY FIXES (AFTER BUILD)
-----------------------------------
Once application launches, verify:

[ ] Splash Screen
    - Shows for 3 seconds (not 1 second)
    - Displays "ELASTIC SOFTWORKS 2025"
    - Displays "NEW WORLD APPLICATIONS" under WORLDENV
    - Rainbow gradient animation visible
    - Logo glow/pulse animation visible
    - Background watermarks visible

[ ] UI Panels Visible
    - Hierarchy panel on left
    - Viewport panel in center
    - Inspector panel on right
    - Asset browser at bottom
    - All panels show appropriate empty states

[ ] Welcome Overlay in Viewport
    - Appears when no project open
    - Shows "WORLDEDIT" title
    - Shows "ELASTIC SOFTWORKS 2025"
    - Shows "NEW WORLD APPLICATIONS"
    - Shows "New Project" button
    - Shows "Open Project" button
    - Message about panels being ready

[ ] Menu System Console Output
    - Open Developer Tools (View > Toggle Developer Tools)
    - Check console tab
    - Click File > New Project - should see [MENU] log
    - Click File > Open Project - should see [MENU] log
    - Click File > Save Project - should see [MENU] log
    - Click Edit > Undo - should see [MENU] log
    - Click View > Reload - should see [MENU] log
    - Click Build > Build Project - should see [MENU] log

[ ] Window Controls
    - Minimize button works (doesn't freeze)
    - Maximize button works
    - Close button works
    - Window can be resized
    - Window can be moved

[ ] Theme Switching
    - Can toggle between light and dark mode
    - All panels update when theme changes
    - Theme persists between sessions

KNOWN ISSUES TO INVESTIGATE (AFTER BUILD)
==========================================

1. Minimize Button Behavior
   Previous Report: "Clicking minimize freezes app mid-animation"
   Test: Click Window > Minimize or window chrome minimize button
   Expected: Window minimizes smoothly
   If Issue Persists: Check window manager event handlers

2. Open Project Behavior
   Previous Report: "Opening project doesn't change UI"
   Test: File > Open Project > Select a directory
   Expected: UI updates, panels show project content
   If Issue Persists: Check project state propagation

3. View/Build/Help Menu Items
   Previous Report: "These buttons don't work"
   Test: Click each menu item
   Expected: Console shows [MENU] messages
   If Issue Persists: Check IPC handlers

4. Light Mode
   Previous Report: "Can't switch to light mode"
   Test: View > Theme > Light Mode (or similar)
   Expected: UI changes to light theme
   If Issue Persists: Check theme context and persistence

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
======================

After building, verify each item by checking it off:

CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Must be working)
------------------------------------
[ ] 1. All UI panels visible on startup
[ ] 2. Welcome overlay shows in viewport when no project
[ ] 3. Menu actions produce console output
[ ] 4. Splash screen shows for 3 seconds with new branding

HIGH PRIORITY (Should be working)
----------------------------------
[ ] 5. Window controls (minimize/maximize/close) work
[ ] 6. New project creation works
[ ] 7. Open project works and updates UI
[ ] 8. Theme switching works

MEDIUM PRIORITY (Nice to have)
-------------------------------
[ ] 9. Splash screen theme adapts to light/dark mode
[ ] 10. Graphics fallback system handles WebGL failures

BUILD VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
=============================

Before running the application:
[ ] Node.js 18+ installed
[ ] npm install completed without errors
[ ] npm run build:main completed without errors
[ ] npm run build:renderer completed without errors
[ ] dist/main/main.js exists
[ ] dist/renderer/index.html exists

TESTING WORKFLOW
================

1. BUILD
   cd worldenv/editor
   ./BUILD-AND-TEST.sh

2. LAUNCH
   Application should start automatically after build
   Or manually: npm start

3. OBSERVE
   - Watch splash screen for 3 seconds
   - Look for new branding text
   - Look for animations

4. VERIFY UI
   - All panels should be visible
   - Welcome overlay in viewport
   - Empty states in other panels

5. TEST MENUS
   - Open Developer Tools (View > Toggle Developer Tools)
   - Click menu items
   - Watch console for [MENU] messages

6. TEST FUNCTIONALITY
   - Try creating a new project
   - Try opening a project
   - Try switching themes
   - Try window controls

7. DOCUMENT RESULTS
   - Use hitl/index.html checklist
   - Record actual behavior
   - Attach screenshots if needed
   - Generate JSON report

SUCCESS CRITERIA
================

Build Phase Success:
✓ No compilation errors
✓ dist/ directory exists
✓ All expected files in dist/

Launch Phase Success:
✓ Application starts without crashes
✓ Splash screen appears
✓ Main window opens

UI Phase Success:
✓ All panels visible
✓ Welcome overlay shows
✓ No blank screens
✓ No missing components

Functionality Phase Success:
✓ Menu items work
✓ Console shows logging
✓ Window controls work
✓ Theme switching works

ESTIMATED TIME
==============

Build Process: 2-5 minutes
Testing: 30-60 minutes
Documentation: 15-30 minutes
Total: 45-95 minutes

NOTES FOR NEXT HITL ROUND
==========================

1. Always build before testing
2. Check dist/ exists before assuming changes are live
3. Use Developer Tools console for debugging
4. Document actual behavior, not expected behavior
5. Take screenshots of any visual issues
6. Test menu items systematically
7. Verify all panels before testing features

DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW GOING FORWARD
===================================

For Future Changes:
1. Make source code changes
2. Run ./BUILD-AND-TEST.sh
3. Test changes
4. Document results
5. Commit changes

For Development Work:
1. Run ./BUILD-AND-TEST.sh --dev
2. Code will rebuild automatically
3. Faster iteration cycle

For Quick Testing:
1. Run ./BUILD-AND-TEST.sh --skip-install
2. Skips npm install if deps haven't changed

CONTACT/ESCALATION
==================

If build fails:
- Check Node.js version (need 18+)
- Check for npm errors in output
- Try: rm -rf node_modules && npm install
- Try: rm -rf dist && npm run build

If tests fail:
- Document exact steps to reproduce
- Capture console output
- Take screenshots
- Use hitl/index.html to report

If totally stuck:
- Read hitl/docs/test1-action-plan.txt
- Review this file again
- Check BUILD-AND-TEST.sh output

END OF TODO
