WORLDENV TEST 3 IMPLEMENTATION TODO
===================================

Based on third round testing feedback, the core issue is that WorldEdit (editor)
and WorldC (engine) are not integrated. The editor works as a shell but cannot

DEPENDENCIES & INTEGRATION POINTS
==================================

The key insight is that WorldEdit (editor) needs to become a true IDE that:
1. Manages WorldC code compilation and execution
2. Provides visual tools for scene/entity/component management
3. Integrates 3D/2D rendering for real-time preview
4. Handles asset pipeline for textures, models, audio
5. Compiles projects to deployable applications

This requires deep integration between the Electron app (WorldEdit) and the
WorldC language/runtime system, with the editor serving as the visual frontend
to a complete game development pipeline.

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE NOTES
=============================

The implementation should follow this architecture:
- Main Process: Engine management, file operations, build system
- Renderer Process: UI, viewport rendering, script editing
- WorldC Runtime: Language compilation, scene execution, asset processing
- IPC Layer: Communication between editor and engine components

Success criteria: Editor can create scenes, add entities with components,
import assets, write WORLDC scripts, preview in viewport, and build
deployable applications - making it a complete development environment.
