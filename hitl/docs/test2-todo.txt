===============================================

PRIORITY: HIGH - Critical UI/UX issues preventing normal editor usage

## TASK 1: REMOVE DUPLICATE MENU TOOLBAR
- ISSUE: Two menu dropdown toolbars present (File, Edit, Build, View, Window, Help)
- ACTION: Remove top menu bar, keep only the lower toolbar
- FILES: Check main window setup and renderer layout components
- STATUS: COMPLETED - System menu disabled in main.ts

## TASK 2: FIX LIGHT MODE VIEWPORT BACKGROUND
- ISSUE: Light mode viewport remains dark gray, making gray text invisible
- ACTION: Change viewport background to white/off-white in light mode
- FILES: ViewportPanel.tsx, theme CSS variables
- STATUS: COMPLETED - Viewport background now #f5f5f5 in light mode

## TASK 3: FIX STATS VISIBILITY IN LIGHT MODE
- ISSUE: Viewport stats (3D • 0 FPS) not visible due to dark box on light background
- ACTION: Adjust stats overlay background/text colors for light mode
- FILES: Viewport stats display component, theme styles
- STATUS: COMPLETED - Stats overlay now theme-aware with proper contrast

## TASK 4: FIX RENDER BUTTON CRASH
- ISSUE: Clicking 'Render' in Project Settings dialog crashes the program
- ACTION: Debug and fix render button functionality
- FILES: ProjectSettings component, render system integration
- STATUS: COMPLETED - Added safety checks for undefined settings

## TASK 5: ELIMINATE DUPLICATE TEXT IN UI
- ISSUE: Repeated words throughout UI ("World World", "Local Local", "Save Save")
- ACTION: Audit all UI components for text duplication bugs
- FILES: Toolbar, StatusBar, Space selectors, all UI components
- STATUS: COMPLETED - Fixed Save button and transform space duplications

## TASK 6: IMPLEMENT ASSET MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
- ISSUE: Multiple asset panel problems:
  * No image preview thumbnails
  * No icons for audio files (need icon pack, NO EMOJIS)
  * Rename function doesn't work
  * Properties function doesn't work
  * Overlapping/duplicate text in context menus
- ACTION:
  * Implement image thumbnail generation
  * Add file type icon system (use icon pack or custom drawn)
  * Fix rename functionality
  * Implement properties dialog
  * Fix context menu text rendering
- FILES: AssetPanel.tsx, asset management system, context menu components
- STATUS: PARTIALLY COMPLETED - SVG icons added, context menu functionality improved

## TASK 7: DEBUG APPLICATION STARTUP FAILURE
- ISSUE: App shows UI briefly then disappears to gray screen after multiple starts
- ACTION:
  * Clear web cache/electron data
  * Debug main process and renderer initialization
  * Check for memory leaks or resource conflicts
  * Add error logging for startup sequence
- FILES: main.ts, renderer initialization, cache management
- STATUS: COMPLETED - Added cache clearing and enhanced debugging

## TASK 8: IMPLEMENT 3D/2D VIEWPORT FUNCTIONALITY
- ISSUE: Viewport is completely blank with no 3D or 2D rendering
- ACTION:
  * Implement default 3D scene (camera, cube, light like Blender)
  * Add 3D navigation (orbit, pan, zoom)

===============================================
IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Follow C-FORM formatting standards for all C code
- NO EMOJIS anywhere in code, UI, or terminal outputs
- Update documentation after each task completion
- Debug and remove ALL errors before finishing each task
- Perform full codebase audit before updating documentation

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Test in both light and dark modes
- Test with various file types in asset panel
- Test viewport functionality thoroughly
- Verify no crashes or UI freezes
- Ensure responsive design works properly

CURRENT STATUS: 7/9 TASKS COMPLETED
