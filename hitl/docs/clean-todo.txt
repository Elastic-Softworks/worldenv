WORLDENV CODEBASE CLEANUP & AUDIT TODO
=====================================

CRITICAL CLEANUP ITEMS
======================

1. DISABLED/UNUSED FILES
   [X] Remove worldc/src/semantic/semantic-analyzer.ts.disabled
   [ ] Audit worldc/src/semantic/ - consolidate simple-analyzer.ts with main analyzer
   [ ] Check if semantic analyzer functionality is properly integrated

2. MANAGER CLASS CONSOLIDATION
   [ ] Review 15+ Manager classes in editor/src/main/ for overlap
   [ ] Merge similar functionality:
       - AssetManager + FileHistoryManager (asset tracking overlap)
       - ProjectManager + ProjectTemplateManager + RecentProjectsManager
       - Build system: BuildManager + WCCompilerIntegration coordination
       - Engine coordination: EngineStatusManager + EngineCommunicationManager + ScriptSystemManager

3. NAMING CONSISTENCY
   [ ] Standardize Manager vs Service vs Integration naming
   [X] Fix mixed naming patterns in auto-save.ts (snake_case vs camelCase)
   [ ] Fix remaining naming inconsistencies in other files
       - file_histories vs fileHistories inconsistencies
   [ ] Align interface vs class naming conventions

4. ENGINE INTEGRATION CLEANUP
   [ ] Consolidate engine/ subfolder classes - too many overlapping responsibilities
   [ ] Merge WCCompilerIntegration + WCHotReloadManager into unified service
   [ ] Simplify EngineWrapper + EngineService + EngineCommunicationManager chain
   [ ] Remove redundant script management layers

CODE QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS
=========================

5. C-FORM COMPLIANCE AUDIT
   [ ] Convert all editor TypeScript to follow C-FORM principles where applicable
   [ ] Update worldc C-style code to full C-FORM compliance
   [ ] Standardize comment formatting across codebase
   [ ] Fix alignment and spacing issues found in grep audit

6. DEBUG CODE CLEANUP
   [ ] Remove excessive debug logging calls (found 50+ instances)
   [ ] Implement proper logging levels instead of scattered debug statements
   [ ] Clean up TODO/FIXME comments (convert to proper issues or resolve)

7. DUPLICATE FUNCTIONALITY
   [ ] Asset handling: consolidate thumbnail generation + metadata caching
   [ ] File operations: merge file-system.ts overlaps with other managers
   [ ] Dialog management: consolidate DialogManager with dialog components
   [ ] IPC: simplify IPCManager + EngineCommunicationManager coordination

STRUCTURE OPTIMIZATION
=====================

8. DIRECTORY REORGANIZATION
   [ ] Move engine integration classes to single cohesive module
   [ ] Consolidate utility functions scattered across managers
   [ ] Group related functionality (asset pipeline, build system, etc.)

9. DEPENDENCY CLEANUP
   [ ] Remove unused imports across codebase
   [ ] Audit package.json dependencies for unused packages
   [ ] Consolidate similar dependencies between editor/ and worldc/

10. CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT
    [ ] Unify configuration patterns across managers
    [ ] Implement centralized config validation
    [ ] Remove hardcoded paths and magic numbers

DOCUMENTATION SYNCHRONIZATION
============================

11. UPDATE ALL DOCUMENTATION
    [ ] Audit editor/docs/ - update for current architecture
    [ ] Audit worldc/docs/ - ensure API docs match implementation
    [ ] Update root README.md with current system overview
    [ ] Sync all docs with implementation from test3-todo.txt

12. REMOVE OUTDATED REFERENCES
    [ ] Clean any remaining development-specific terminology
    [ ] Ensure user-facing documentation reflects current state
    [ ] Update troubleshooting guides for consolidated architecture

INTEGRATION FIXES
================

13. WORLDC-EDITOR COMMUNICATION
    [ ] Fix EPIPE errors in compiler integration
    [ ] Streamline build pipeline integration
    [ ] Resolve runtime discovery issues for WorldC compiler

14. BUILD SYSTEM CLEANUP
    [ ] Remove webpack warnings in renderer bundle
    [ ] Optimize large bundle sizes
    [X] Fix dynamic require warnings in compiler integration

TESTING CLEANUP
==============

15. TEST COVERAGE GAPS
    [ ] Add missing unit tests for consolidated managers
    [ ] Update integration tests for new architecture
    [ ] Add error handling tests for engine communication

COMPLETION CRITERIA
==================
- Zero disabled/unused files
- Consistent naming throughout codebase
- All Manager classes have clear, non-overlapping responsibilities
- Full C-FORM compliance in applicable code
- All documentation reflects current implementation
- No debug logging in production code paths
- Clean build with zero warnings
- Successful integration between WorldC and Editor

PROGRESS STATUS
==============
COMPLETED:
- Removed semantic-analyzer.ts.disabled file
- Fixed dynamic require warning in WCCompilerIntegration.ts
- Standardized naming in auto-save.ts (snake_case -> camelCase)
- Live Blueprint system framework implemented

IN PROGRESS:
- Naming consistency across remaining files
- Manager class consolidation analysis
- Debug logging reduction strategy

NEXT PRIORITIES:
1. Complete naming standardization in file-history.ts and project-*.ts files
2. Analyze Manager class overlaps for consolidation opportunities
3. Reduce excessive debug logging calls
4. Update documentation to reflect cleanup changes
